# SARr

Summary tables for U.S. Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports (SARs) include: recent abundance estimates (and their precision); values used to calculate the limit (PBR) on human-caused mortality (N_min, F_r, R_max); estimates of serious injury and mortality, *etc.* 

This package includes .csv files with the 2014 summary tables and *R* code to summarize the information in those tables. The tables were downloaded from: http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/region.htm

Unfortunately, at the time of downloading (2014), the tables were only available in PDF files. It was necessary to edit these by hand after copying into a spreadsheet, prior to saving as .csv files. No promise of error-free transcription is implied.
